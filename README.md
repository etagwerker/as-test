# ActiveStorage Test

This is a project to show how to add a prefix to an attachment submitted via ActiveStorage.

It creates a new service to upload the attached file (as explained here: https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/32790#issuecomment-487523740)

You will need to set up your AWS credentials inside the `.env` file.
